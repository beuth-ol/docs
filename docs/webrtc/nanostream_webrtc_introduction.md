## End-to-end live streaming workflow

### What is nanoStream Webcaster?

nanoStream Webcaster enables live video streaming directly from your browser, either from desktop PCs or mobile phones. You can connect a webcam, use the built-in camera or even send your desktop screen contents as a live source to your audience.

Webcasting can be used for instant presentations without any download, for e-learning or webcasting of events like live auctions.

The idea is not point-to-point communication like in a video conference, but 1-to-many, or many-to-many.

nanoStream Webcaster is available as a simple demo web page, but also as an API which can be easily embedded into custom web pages (white label, run under your own brand).

nanoStream Webcaster is a powerful live encoding tool for browser-based interactive live streaming. Combining it with the unique nanoStream Cloud with integrated nanoStream H5Live Player creates an end-to-end workflow for scalable ultra-low-latency live streams worldwide.

nanoStream Webcaster is formerly knows as WebRTC.live, based on the WebRTC technology. The former name WebRTC.live was removed to avoid confusion with the underlying technologies. Playback with H5Live is not based on WebRTC.

## What is H5Live?

nanoStream H5Live is a unique delivery and playback technology working on all HTML5 browsers. It is a unique development by nanocosmos based on existing HTML5 / streaming technologies like `HLS`, `fMP4`, and `Websockets` (not WebRTC); dependent on the target device and browser, the stream format is automatically chosen. In combination with nanoStream Webcaster ingest and nanoStream Cloud for delivery, the H5Live solution creates a scalable solution for large audiences.

H5Live is connected to the delivery/playback parts of nanoStream Cloud, as nanoStream Webcaster is connected to the ingest/encoding part.

## nanoStream Cloud

nanoStream Cloud contains all software and services for interactive live streaming worldwide. It includes a global CDN (content delivery network) of ingest and edge servers which is designed for ultra-low-latency worldwide for global audiences. nanoStream Webcaster and H5Live web clients are seemlessly integrated into this architecture and automatically choose the closest server locations available to the user.
