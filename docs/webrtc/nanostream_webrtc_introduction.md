## End-to-end live streaming workflow

### What is nanoStream Webcaster?

nanoStream Webcaster enables live video streaming directly from your browser, either from desktop PCs or mobile phones. You can connect a webcam, use the built-in camera or even send your desktop screen contents as a live source to your audience.

Webcasting can be used for instant presentations without any download, for e-learning or webcasting of events like live auctions.

nanoStream Webcaster is available as a simple demo web page, but also as an API which can be easily embedded into custom web pages (white label, run under your own brand).

nanoStream Webcaster is a powerful live encoding tool for browser-based interactive live streaming. Combining it with the unique nanoStream Cloud with integrated nanoStream H5Live Player creates an end-to-end workflow for scalable ultra-low-latency live streams worldwide.

## What is H5Live?

nanoStream H5Live is a unique delivery and playback technology working on all HTML5 browsers. It is a unique development by nanocosmos based on existing HTML5 / streaming technologies like `HLS`, `fMP4`, and `Websockets` (not WebRTC); dependent on the target device and browser, the stream format is automatically chosen. In combination with nanoStream Webcaster ingest and nanoStream Cloud for delivery, the H5Live solution creates a scalable solution for large audiences.

H5Live is connected to the delivery/playback parts of nanoStream Cloud, as nanoStream Webcaster is connected to the ingest/encoding part.

## nanoStream Cloud

nanoStream Cloud contains all software and services for interactive live streaming worldwide. It includes a global CDN (content delivery network) of ingest and edge servers which is designed for ultra-low-latency worldwide for global audiences. nanoStream Webcaster and H5Live web clients are seemlessly integrated into this architecture and automatically choose the closest server locations available to the user.
