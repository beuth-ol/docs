## End-to-end live streaming workflow

As we learned in[ this article](https://www.nanocosmos.de/blog/2018/02/build-browser-based-live-streaming-workflow-webrtc-live/), nanoStream WebRTC.live is a powerful live encoding tool for browser-based interactive live streaming. Combining it with the unique nanoStream Cloud with integrated nanoStream H5Live Player creates an end-to-end workflow for scalable ultra-low-latency live streams worldwide.

## What is H5Live?

nanoStream H5Live is a unique delivery and playback technology working on all HTML5 browsers. It is a unique development by nanocosmos based on existing HTML5 / streaming technologies like `HLS`, `fMP4`, and `Websockets`; dependent on the target device and browser, the stream format is automatically chosen. In combination with nanoStream WebRTC.live ingest and nanoStream Cloud for delivery, the H5Live solution creates a scalable solution for large audiences.

H5Live is connected to the delivery/playback parts of nanoStream Cloud, as WebRTC.live is connected to the ingest/encoding part.

## nanoStream Cloud Global Footprint

nanoStream Cloud contains all software and services for interactive live streaming worldwide. It includes a global CDN (content delivery network) of ingest and edge servers which is designed for ultra-low-latency worldwide for global audiences. WebRTC.live and H5Live web clients are seemlessly integrated into this architecture and automatically choose the closest server locations available to the user.
