## Screen Sharing 

Webcasting based on `WebRTC` supports screen sharing! You can use a screen or a window, depending on a browser used, as a live video source instead of a web camera.

Screen sharing is currently available in:

  * Google Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Safari

Screen sharing is directly built-in. For early versions, a certified browser extension was required due to Google security policy. This is not required anymore.

The Webcaster API is "videoDeviceConfig.source", see the API description.
