The nanoStream Webcaster supports screen sharing.

Instead of a web camera you can use a screen or a window as a live video source, depending on the browser used.

## Supported Browsers

Screen sharing is currently available for desktop browsers:

  * Google Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Safari

Screen sharing is directly built-in. For early versions, a certified browser extension was required due to Google security policy. This is not required anymore.

The Webcaster API is "videoDeviceConfig.source", see the API description.
