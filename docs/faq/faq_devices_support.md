<details><summary><strong>Are there any drawbacks when using deinterlacing for non-interlaced material?</strong></summary>

The drawbacks of having deinterlacing turned on all the time are:

- degraded picture quality for non-interlaced material (The picture quality degration is dependent on the deinterlacer algorithm. Using a good algorithm, quality should not be affected.)
- higher cpu load (the amount of extra cpu time required depends on the algorithm used for deinterlacing - algorithm requiring more cpu time produce better results)
