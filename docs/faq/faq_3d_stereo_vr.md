<details><summary><strong>Can I stream 3D video in HD?</strong></summary>

In general, yes.
But it depends if your hardware (especially the cpu) is performant enough to handle the encoding process. It can be an option to use the `“nanocosmos H.264 Video Encoder QS” filter` for hardware encoding.

>Another factor to consider is the available bandwidth, because `HD` requires a higher bitrate >than lower resolution such as `320×240` or `640×480`.
