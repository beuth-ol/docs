<details><summary><strong>How to make the player responsive and preserve the aspect ratio?</strong></summary>
<br>The following example is for a **16:9 ratio**, which can be changed to work for all other aspect ratios.

### 1. Player configuration
Set the `style.width` and `style.height` properties inside the player config to `auto` to  keep the size of the parent container.

```
    // player config 
    var config = {
        "style": {
            "width": "auto",
            "height": "auto"
        },
        ...
    }
```

### 2. Player DIV CSS
Set a percentage value for `padding-bottom` to maintain the aspect ratio of the players `<div>` element.
<br>For a 16:9 aspect ratio: **(9 / 16 = 0.5625) = 56.25%**

``` 
    <body>
        <div id="playerDiv" style="padding-bottom: 56.25%"></div>
    </body>
```

### Other aspect ratios

| Aspect ratio | padding-bottom |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| 1:1          | 100%           |
| 16:9         | 56.25%         |
| 4:3          | 75%            |

<summary><strong>How to embed the player into an iframe element?</strong></summary>
For most use cases the implementation of the player directly into the page is the best option. We recommend embedding the player within an iframe element only when the use case requires it.

### 1. Creating the embedded page including the player on your side

Please find information and examples on how to add the player to a webpage [here](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_getting_started/).

### 2. Embedding the player page in an iframe on a second page on the distribution side

**Important:** The `allowfullscreen` attribute is required if the page wants to support fullscreen video.

```
    <iframe id="ifvideo" width="640" height="480" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""
    src="//yourdomain.com/playerpage.html">
    </iframe>
```

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Can I use a raw player without built-in controls, animations and styles?</strong></summary>

Yes, by passing the config property `style.view = false`. 

The view is the top level UI layer containing all built-in controls, animations and styles including automatic video scaling. 
Disabling the view will disable these features as well. 
Therefore this is recommended for experienced users only. 

> **Important:**
> If you create custom controls or other overlay elements make sure to set the `z-index` value > 1 to ensure they are positioned on top of the video layer.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Can I customize the inline controls?</strong></summary>

No, but you can disable them by passing.

```
config.style.controls = false;
```

> **Important:**
> If you create custom controls or other overlay elements make sure to set the `z-index` value > 1 to ensure they are positioned on top of the video layer.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Can I style the player as audio player?</strong></summary>

Yes, you can style the player as audio player by passing

```javascript
config.style.audioPlayer = true;
```

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Can I play video only or audio only streams?</strong></summary>

Yes.


</details>

<details><summary><strong>Can I use an own external video element?</strong></summary>

Yes, by passing the `id` attribute of an existing html5 video element through the config property `playback.videoId`. The video will be inserted into the players container and existing styles will be overwritten and restored after a destroy.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Can I update the source?</strong></summary>

Yes, by executing the playerâ€™s function `updateSource` with an updated `config.source` object.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Is a fullscreen functionality available?</strong></summary>

Yes, via the bottom right fullscreen button on the built-in H5live player control bar.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Can I use a poster as placeholder for the video?</strong></summary>

But you can use a workaround by passing the id of an existing video tag with poster through the config (`config.playback.videoId`). This video element would be used by the player instead of creating a new one. See [here](../../nanoplayer/nanoplayer_api).

Another possibility can be that you grab the video element from the DOM after successful setup and then modify the poster attribute.

```javascript
var video = document.querySelector("#playerDiv video");
video.poster = ....;
```

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Can I change the background color of the player?</strong></summary>
No, currently there is no way to configure the background-color of the video element, but you can have workarounds. You can select the video in the resolve function of the promise (see the sample) and then change the color or you can create a global css rule for video elements. Please see the following examples.

```javascript
var player; 
  var config = {
    "source": {
        "bintu": {
            "apiurl": "https://bintu.nanocosmos.de",
            "streamid": "236af21e-fbf3-4ba3-889c-343ef3f0e7ca"
        }
    },
   "playback": {
      "autoplay": true,
      "automute": true,
      "muted": false
  },
  "style": {
      "controls": true,
      "width": "auto",
      "height": "auto",    
      }
};
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    player = new NanoPlayer("playerDiv");
    player.setup(config).then(function (config) {
        console.log("setup success");
        console.log("config: " + JSON.stringify(config, undefined, 4));
        var video = document.querySelector('#playerDiv video');
        video.style.backgroundColor = '#123456';
    }, function (error) {
        alert(error.message);
    });
});
```

```
<style>
    video {
        background-color: #123456;
    }
</style>
```

<details><summary><strong>Is there a simple code snippet available?</strong></summary>

Yes. Please check out the 'Getting started' topic in the documentation. 
https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_getting_started/

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Can I use the player within a mobile webview?</strong></summary>

Yes. Some mobile webviews require configuration flags to be set on the app level 
to allow, e.g. inline playback or playback without user interaction (autoplay). 
Examples
iOS: allowsInlineMediaPlayback, mediaTypesRequiringUserActionForPlayback 
Android: setMediaPlaybackRequiresUserGesture

Please check the documentation of the webview component.

<details><summary><strong>Can I have multiple player instances in one page?</strong></summary>

Yes. Please check out the nanoplayer-multi sample in the player package.
