# Does the software automatically adjust the Bitrate - Adaptive Bitrate?

The nanoStream Live Encoder Software has this feature for streams to adjust the bitrate to the existing bandwidth for the rtmp upstream. 

See [general information here](live_video_encoder_-_adaptive_bitrate) and [plugin information here](live_video_encoder_-_plugin_integration_api) for how to enable the adaptive bitrate on the application and nanoStream API level.

[See here for a DirectShow description to dynamically set the bit rate.](directshow-adaptive_bitrate)
